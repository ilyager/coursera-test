      A powerhouse of European football, Germany (West Germany from 1945 to 1990) have only once (1968) failed to qualify for the finals of either the UEFA European Championship or a FIFA World Cup that they have entered. They have won the World Cup four times, claiming the global prize in 1954, 1974 and 1990 and 2014, and became champions of Europe in 1972, 1980 and 1996. They have also been runners-up in three European Championships and four World Cups. Although it is almost two decades since their last EURO triumph, they have reached at least the semi-finals of the last two tournaments.

      Portugal ended a lengthy semi-final jinx for UEFA European Championship host nations when they made it through to the Lisbon showpiece in 2004, but defeat by Greece meant they became the only team in the competition's history to lose a final on home turf. Since then, with Cristiano Ronaldo an increasingly potent attacking force, Portugal have reached two semi-finals – at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA EURO 2012, losing in the latter to Spain on penalties. They have a perfect qualification record for major tournaments since the turn of the millennium, which was extended by a group-topping performance en route to UEFA EURO 2016.

      Les Bleus have a happy habit of fulfilling expectations on home soil. They won the 1984 UEFA European Championship, when Michel Platini drove them to victory with a record-breaking final tournament haul of nine goals, and claimed the FIFA World Cup for the one and only time in 1998 when another famous No10, Zinédine Zidane, inspired them to victory with two goals in the final against Brazil (3-0).
